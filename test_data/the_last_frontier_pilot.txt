FADE IN:

EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - DAWN

The vast, snow-covered expanse of the Brooks Range. Nothing but white mountains stretching to the horizon. A speck of red moves through the landscape - a single CESSNA 185 bush plane fighting the wind.

SUPER: "The Last Frontier - Population: 732"

INT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

MAGGIE CHEN (35), hard-edged, weathered, grips the controls with practiced confidence. She's been flying these skies for fifteen years.

Her passenger, DR. ELIJAH CROSS (40s), African American, Harvard Medical School jacket, looks terrified. He clutches his medical bag like a life preserver.

MAGGIE
You gonna be sick, Doc?

ELIJAH
(through gritted teeth)
I'm fine. Just... focused.

MAGGIE
(smirking)
That's what they all say. Last surgeon
I flew up here painted my floorboards.

ELIJAH
I'm not a surgeon. I'm an internist.

MAGGIE
Well, internist, we got about twenty
minutes of this. So find your sea legs.

EXT. REMOTE VILLAGE - DAY

The plane touches down on a rough gravel strip. A dozen VILLAGERS wait - elders, children, worried faces. This is KOYUKUK, population 94, accessible only by air.

Maggie hops out, helps Elijah with his bag.

MAGGIE
(introducing)
Dr. Cross, meet your new home.

ELIJAH
(looking around)
There's no hospital.

MAGGIE
(points to small building)
That's the clinic. You're it.

Elijah stares at the tiny structure. A WOMAN rushes forward, holding a crying BABY.

WOMAN
Doctor, please. My daughter. She's burning.

Elijah looks at Maggie, overwhelmed. She nods - go on.

ELIJAH
Right. Let's take a look.

He follows the woman, glancing back at Maggie. She gives him a small, encouraging smile.

TITLE CARD: THE LAST FRONTIER

INT. CLINIC - DAY

Cramped but functional. Elijah examines the baby while a NURSE TRANSLATOR (50s), Inupiat, helps communicate.

The baby has a HIGH FEVER, 103 degrees. Elijah works efficiently, professionally - checking ears, throat, lungs.

ELIJAH
(to nurse)
Ask when the fever started.

NURSE
(speaks Inupiaq)

WOMAN
(responds)

NURSE
Three days. She's been giving her
willow bark tea.

ELIJAH
That's good. Smart. But she needs
antibiotics. I think it's pneumonia.

He pulls medication from his bag, prepares a shot. The baby cries.

ELIJAH (CONT'D)
(softly)
I know, little one. I know.

He administers the shot with gentle efficiency. The mother watches, grateful and wary.

EXT. KOYUKUK VILLAGE - DAY

Elijah steps outside, exhausted. Maggie leans against her plane, eating an apple.

MAGGIE
Saved your first patient.

ELIJAH
I'm not sure. She needs a hospital.
Real equipment. A pediatric specialist.

MAGGIE
Nearest hospital is 250 miles. You
are the specialist now.

ELIJAH
(quietly)
I left Boston for this? Three weeks
ago I was at Mass General.

MAGGIE
And now you're here. They need you
more than Mass General ever did.

Elijah looks at the village - simple homes, no roads, satellite dishes on every roof connecting them to a world away.

ELIJAH
Why do you do it? Fly people in and
out of nowhere?

MAGGIE
My father was a bush pilot. His
before him. It's in the blood.

She tosses him an apple. He catches it.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Come on, Doc. Dinner at my place.
Tomorrow we fly to Anaktuvuk Pass.

ELIJAH
Another village?

MAGGIE
Another village.

INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rustic but warm. Photos everywhere - Maggie with various people, planes, the northern lights.

Maggie cooks. Elijah explores the photos. One shows Maggie with a MAN and a TEENAGE BOY, all smiles.

ELIJAH
Family?

Maggie's back stiffens.

MAGGIE
Was. Husband and son. Five years ago.
Plane went down in a whiteout.

ELIJAH
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

MAGGIE
You didn't know. But that's why I do
it, Doc. Because up here, flying isn't
just transport. It's life. And when
it goes wrong...

She turns, composed but pained.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
You have another reason for coming here?
Besides the adventure?

ELIJAH
My wife died. Eight months ago.
Cancer. She was... she was everything.

MAGGIE
So you ran to the end of the earth.

ELIJAH
I ran to where I could do something
that matters. Where I couldn't think.

They share a moment of mutual understanding - two broken people at the edge of the world.

EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAWN

Maggie preflights her plane. Elijah approaches with coffee.

ELIJAH
How many communities do you serve?

MAGGIE
Twelve. Population ranging from 40
to 400. I'm the only medevac for
500 miles.

ELIJAH
What happens when you can't fly?

MAGGIE
People die.

Simple. Brutal. True.

A TEENAGE GIRL, SOPHIE (16), approaches. She's angry, defiant.

SOPHIE
You taking the doctor to Anaktuvuk?

MAGGIE
I am.

SOPHIE
I'm coming.

MAGGIE
No, you're not.

SOPHIE
My grandmother lives there. She has
cancer. The doctor should see her.

MAGGIE
Sophie, you're fifteen and reckless.
Last time I let you in my plane you
almost broke the door.

SOPHIE
I'm sixteen now. And I'm going.

Elijah watches this exchange. He steps forward.

ELIJAH
She can come. If she promises to sit
still and not touch anything.

Maggie glares at him. Sophie beams.

MAGGIE
(to Elijah)
You're undermining my authority.

ELIJAH
She has a right to see her grandmother.
Just like you had a right to...

He trails off. Maggie gets it.

MAGGIE
Fine. But you watch her. And Sophie - 
you touch one dial, you're walking home.

INT. BUSH PLANE - DAY

Sophie sits in back, sullen but excited. Elijah in front.

MAGGIE
(into radio)
Fairbanks Center, this is November-Three-
Charlie-Bravo, departing Koyukuk for
Anaktuvuk Pass. Flight time one hour
twenty. Over.

RADIO (V.O.)
Copy November-Three-Charlie-Bravo.
Weather's shifting. Storm front moving
in from the west. Advise caution.

MAGGIE
Copy that. We'll keep an eye on it.

She glances at Elijah.

MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Storms up here aren't like Boston.
They'll kill you quick.

ELIJAH
I believe you.

EXT. ALASKAN SKIES - DAY

The plane soars over breathtaking terrain - mountains, rivers, endless wilderness.

Suddenly, the plane JOLTS. Turbulence.

INT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

MAGGIE
(into radio)
Fairbanks, this is Three-Charlie-Bravo.
Hitting unexpected chop at 5,500.
What's the updated forecast?

RADIO (V.O.)
Storm's moving faster than predicted.
You need to turn back or push through.
Can't guarantee the Pass will stay open.

Maggie checks her instruments, the horizon. The sky ahead is darkening.

ELIJAH
Maggie?

MAGGIE
(thinking)
We turn back, Sophie's grandmother
waits another week. Maybe more.

SOPHIE
Please. She's dying.

Maggie makes her decision.

MAGGIE
(into radio)
Fairbanks, we're continuing. Request
weather updates every ten minutes.

RADIO (V.O.)
Roger that. Good luck, Maggie.

The plane continues into darkening skies.

EXT. ANAKTUVUK PASS - LATER

The plane emerges from clouds, makes a rough landing on a snowy strip.

INT. BUSH PLANE - DAY

They're all shaken. Sophie looks scared now - the reality of the risk hitting home.

MAGGIE
(turning to her)
You okay?

SOPHIE
(nods, small voice)
Thank you.

Maggie softens.

MAGGIE
Your grandmother's lucky to have you.

EXT. ANAKTUVUK PASS VILLAGE - DAY

A small INUPIAT community. Sophie leads them to a modest home.

INT. SOPHIE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

ELDER LUCY (70s), frail but dignified, lies in bed. Her daughter, SUSAN (45), tends her.

Sophie rushes to her side.

SOPHIE
Aana, I brought the doctor.

Elijah approaches respectfully.

ELIJAH
Hello, Lucy. I'm Dr. Cross.

LUCY
(weak smile)
You came through the storm?

ELIJAH
(looks at Maggie)
We had a good pilot.

Maggie smiles, steps back to give them privacy.

EXT. ANAKTUVUK PASS - DAY

Maggie waits by the plane, watching the storm roll in. Elijah emerges.

ELIJAH
She needs hospice care. Comfort, not
cure. I can help manage her pain.

MAGGIE
Can you stay overnight? Storm's
closing the Pass.

ELIJAH
I figured.

They look at the approaching storm - a wall of white descending from the mountains.

ELIJAH (CONT'D)
This is your life? Flying into storms,
stranded in villages, never knowing
if you'll get home?

MAGGIE
Home is wherever I land, Doc.

ELIJAH
Call me Elijah.

MAGGIE
(smiles)
Elijah. Biblical prophet. Fitting.

ELIJAH
Fitting how?

MAGGIE
You're here to save people too. Just
different wilderness.

They share a look - the beginning of understanding, partnership.

INT. LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Elijah administers pain medication. Susan and Sophie watch. Lucy rests easier.

Maggie enters, snow dusting her coat.

MAGGIE
Storm's bad. We'll be here until
morning at least.

SUSAN
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

EXT. ANAKTUVUK PASS - NIGHT

The storm rages. But inside the village, lights glow warm.

INT. LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The group shares a simple meal. Lucy, medicated but lucid, tells stories.

LUCY
...and that's when the bear took my
husband's favorite rifle. Never saw
him so mad.

Everyone laughs. Elijah looks around this makeshift family - Sophie, Susan, Maggie, these strangers who welcomed him.

ELIJAH
(to Lucy)
Thank you. For sharing your home.

LUCY
You came through the storm for me.
Least I can do.

Maggie catches Elijah's eye. He looks at peace for the first time.

EXT. ANAKTUVUK PASS - DAWN

The storm has passed. The landscape is pristine, transformed.

Maggie and Elijah stand by the plane, preparing to leave.

ELIJAH
She passed. An hour ago. Peacefully.
Sophie's with her.

MAGGIE
Good death. Up here, that matters.

ELIJAH
I couldn't save her. The cancer...

MAGGIE
You gave her peace. Gave her family
peace. That's the job, Elijah.

ELIJAH
I spent my whole career in Boston
treating rich people's colds. Here...

MAGGIE
Here you matter.

ELIJAH
I want to stay. If you'll have me.
If these people will have me.

MAGGIE
They already do.

Sophie emerges from the house, eyes red but composed. She approaches Maggie.

SOPHIE
Thank you. For getting me here.

MAGGIE
Anytime, kid. Anytime.

SOPHIE
(to Elijah)
Will you come back? To check on
my mom?

ELIJAH
I'll be back next week. And the week
after. As long as you need me.

Sophie hugs him, quick and fierce, then runs back inside.

Elijah and Maggie climb into the plane.

INT. BUSH PLANE - DAY

Maggie starts the engine.

MAGGIE
You know, I fly to twelve villages.
Over a thousand patients who need
regular care. One doctor can't do it all.

ELIJAH
One doctor can start.

MAGGIE
(smiles)
Yeah. One doctor can start.

The plane taxis, takes off.

EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - DAY

The red plane soars over the vast, beautiful wilderness - two healers heading toward the next village in need.

ELIJAH (V.O.)
They say the last frontier isn't a
place. It's a choice. To go where
you're needed. To become who you were
meant to be.

The plane disappears into the endless sky.

FADE OUT.

THE END
